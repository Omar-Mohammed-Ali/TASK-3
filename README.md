# TASK-3

Tasks Performed

1. Data Import & Preprocessing
 Loaded the dataset using pandas.
 Checked for null values and dropped missing records.
 Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

2. Train-Test Split
Split the data into **training** and **testing** sets using train_test_split (80/20).

3. Model Training
Applied Multiple Linear Regression using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.
Also demonstrated Simple Linear Regression using a single feature (Area).

4. Model Evaluation
Used the following performance metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MSE (Mean Squared Error)
RÂ² Score

5. Visualization
Plotted the regression line for simple linear regression.
Plotted actual vs predicted prices for model performance analysis.
Displayed feature coefficients to interpret model weights.
